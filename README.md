# Project Specifications
## Create a Windows 10 UWP App. The application should incorporate the following elements:
<br>A responsive UI across the Windows 10 devices. There are some available for testing and
this includes the IoT core, mobile devices, tablet and PC. This includes Visual State
Management and using available SDKs for individual device types.
<br><br>A UI that has been well designed and is fit for purpose. User Experience should be carefully
considered while developing the application. The User Experience should be consistent
across devices.
<br><br>Mobile services for data storage and retrieval. The cloud service does not have to be written
in C# to be able to interact with a UWP. The preferred cloud to use is Azure.
<br><br>Use of the MVVM design pattern in the development approach

## About Dreamlo Leaderboard

How does this thing work?<br>
All communication with the server is done through simple HTTP GET requests. In fact you don't even use post or querystrings, you just build a URL. It's super easy!<br>
Every leaderboard has a private URL for adding/deleting scores. This should be compiled in your code. For your website you can use a public URL wich has read access only.


## About Unity 
<img src="https://github.com/gtonra89/UnityGame-UWP/blob/master/blog_thumb_unity.jpg?raw=true">
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies,[5] which is primarily used to develop video games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobile devices. First announced only for OS X, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 27 platforms.

## About UWP 
<img src="https://github.com/gtonra89/UnityGame-UWP/blob/master/uwp.jpg?raw=true">
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is a platform-homogeneous application architecture created by Microsoft and first introduced in Windows 10. The purpose of this software platform is to help develop universal apps that run on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One and Hololens without the need to be re-written for each. It supports Windows app development using C++, C#, VB.NET, and XAML. The API is implemented in C++, and supported in C++, VB.NET, C#, F# and JavaScript. Designed as an extension to the Windows Runtime platform first introduced in Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, UWP allows developers to create apps that will potentially run on multiple types of devices

## About Model View View-Model(MVVM)
<img src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC416621.png" align="middle">
Implementing the Model-View-ViewModel Pattern
<br>
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is an application pattern that isolates the user interface from the underlying business logic. MVVM belongs to a class of patterns called Separated Presentation. These patterns provide a clean separation between the UI and the rest of the application. This improves the testability of the application and allows the application and its UI to evolve more easily and independently. The MVVM pattern consists of the following parts:
The Model, which provides a view-independent representation of your business entities. The design of the model is optimized for the logical relationships and operations between your business entities, regardless of how the data is presented in the user interface.
The View class which is the user interface. It displays information to the user and fires events in response to user interactions.
The ViewModel class, which is the bridge between the view and the model. Each View class has a corresponding ViewModel class. The ViewModel retrieves data from the Model and manipulates it into the format required by the View. It notifies the View if the underlying data in the model is changed, and it updates the data in the Model in response to UI events from the View.
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the View, the ViewModel, and the Model.
The MVVM pattern.

## about Azure
<img src="https://github.com/gtonra89/UnityGame-UWP/blob/master/Microsoft%20Azure.png?raw=true">
Although i did not implement azure i still feel its a pretty nifty cloud platform service and worth a mention

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service and infrastructure as a service and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

<b>Computer</b>
Virtual machines, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) allowing users to launch general-purpose Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines, as well as preconfigured machine images for popular software packages.
App services, platform as a service (PaaS) environment letting developers easily publish and manage websites.
Websites, high density hosting of websites allows developers to build sites using ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js, or Python and can be deployed using FTP, Git, Mercurial, Team Foundation Server or uploaded through the user portal. This feature was announced in preview form in June 2012 at the Meet Microsoft Azure event. Customers can create websites in PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js, or Python, or select from several open source applications from a gallery to deploy. This comprises one aspect of the platform as a service (PaaS) offerings for the Microsoft Azure Platform. It was renamed to Web Apps in April 2015.
WebJobs, applications that can be deployed to a WebApp to implement background processing that can be invoked on a schedule, on demand, or run continuously. The Blob, Table and Queue services can be used to communicate between WebApps and WebJobs and to provide state.

<b>Mobile services</b>
Mobile Engagement collects real-time analytics that highlight usersâ€™ behavior. It also provides push notifications to mobile devices.[7]
HockeyApp can be used to develop, distribute, and beta-test mobile apps[8]


## How to run

on download of the git repositry or clone you will have to downloaded unity then extract and open the game on untiy or even windows visual studio<br>
preferably if on a Windows platform you will be able to navigate to the windows store and search for "jumping jimbob"
or just click the link here to get redirected <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/jumpingjimbob/9nzpn0nrnvfd?SilentAuth=1&wa=wsignin1.0&lc=1033">Jumping JimBob</a>
