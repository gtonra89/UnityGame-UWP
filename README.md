# Project Specifications
## Create a Windows 10 UWP App. The application should incorporate the following elements:
<br>A responsive UI across the Windows 10 devices. There are some available for testing and
this includes the IoT core, mobile devices, tablet and PC. This includes Visual State
Management and using available SDKs for individual device types.
<br><br>A UI that has been well designed and is fit for purpose. User Experience should be carefully
considered while developing the application. The User Experience should be consistent
across devices.
<br><br>Mobile services for data storage and retrieval. The cloud service does not have to be written
in C# to be able to interact with a UWP. The preferred cloud to use is Azure.
<br><br>Use of the MVVM design pattern in the development approach

## About Dreamlo Leaderboard
How does this thing work?<br>
All communication with the server is done through simple HTTP GET requests. In fact you don't even use post or querystrings, you just build a URL. It's super easy!<br>
Every leaderboard has a private URL for adding/deleting scores. This should be compiled in your code. For your website you can use a public URL wich has read access only.


## About Unity
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies,[5] which is primarily used to develop video games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobile devices. First announced only for OS X, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 27 platforms.

## About UWP
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is a platform-homogeneous application architecture created by Microsoft and first introduced in Windows 10. The purpose of this software platform is to help develop universal apps that run on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One and Hololens without the need to be re-written for each. It supports Windows app development using C++, C#, VB.NET, and XAML. The API is implemented in C++, and supported in C++, VB.NET, C#, F# and JavaScript. Designed as an extension to the Windows Runtime platform first introduced in Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, UWP allows developers to create apps that will potentially run on multiple types of devices
